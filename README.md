# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

  -The client, DrverPass has asked for a system that will help aspiring drivers pass their driver's test. Their system will allow for customers to utilize benefits such as practice tests, driving sessions, different typeds of learning content, and seeing updates from the DMV. The class diagram provides an adequate visual display of the system and how the programming will run with the different classes and their qualities. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  -If I could, I would like to add more steps into the use case diagrams. Unfortunately, with the version of Lucidchart we have access to, we were limited on how manyshapes and symbols to use so I had to consolidate some steps togehter. I would have liked to include more in depth steps and loops on the log in process, specifically.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  -After the interview process, we were able to interpret and decipher what would be necessary for the system and how to manage it. We were able to determine the system requirements, determine the constraints and limitations, and use this to create the necessary documents. It is important to consider the user's needs because these determine the steps we need to take in building the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system

  -Once we determined the requirements of the system, we could use the information to help build the use case diagram, some specific use cases, sequence diagram and the class diagram. After this, case we could then put it all together to build the System Design Document. In future builds, I would still utilize having interviews with clients, meeting with the team and determine the requirements, put together some type of schedule to keep progress on track, and use the diagrams to show the system processes.
